**Last Updated: 24 November 2025**

These Terms & Conditions (“Agreement”) outline the rules, responsibilities, and expectations between **Aditya** (“Service Provider”) and the **Client** for web development and related services.

## **1. Scope of Work**

- The Service Provider will deliver web development services as described in the approved proposal, quotation, or agreed-upon project plan.
- Any additional pages, features, functionalities, or design elements not included in the original scope will be treated as **extra work** and may incur additional charges.

## **2. Revisions**

- The Client is entitled to **two (2) rounds of revisions**.
- Revisions are meant for small adjustments (layout tweaks, color changes, text edits, image replacements, minor UI fixes).

- Additional revisions beyond the included two rounds will be charged at **₹500** per revision.

## **3. Timeline & Delays**

- The project timeline will be provided at the start of the project.
- Delays caused by the Client (such as late content, approvals, or feedback) will extend the timeline.
- The Service Provider is not responsible for delays due to third-party tools, hosting issues, domain problems, or circumstances beyond their control.

## **4. Payment Terms**

- The Client must pay **50% of the total project cost upon 50% completion of the project**.

- **No final files, code, or deployment** will be provided until the full payment is cleared.
- **If any scheduled payment is not made on time, the project will be paused immediately** until the payment is received. Delays in payment will result in delays in project delivery.

## **7. Third-Party Services**

- Costs for hosting, domains, premium themes, plugins, APIs, and external services are **not included** unless stated otherwise.
- The Client is responsible for renewal charges or ongoing subscription costs.

## **8. Maintenance & Support**

- Post-delivery maintenance is **not included** unless a maintenance plan is purchased.
- Bug fixes reported within **7 days** of delivery will be checked and addressed for free.
- Any updates, new features, or changes after this period will be billed separately.

## **9. Project Cancellation**

- If the Client cancels the project:
  - If more than 50% of the work is completed, the Client must pay for the work already done.
- If the Service Provider cancels the project, the Client will receive a refund for the incomplete portion.

## **10. Limitation of Liability**

- The Service Provider is not responsible for:
